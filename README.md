# ProjectStash

**ProjectStash** is a repository where I store various side projects and useful code that I’ve worked on over time. It’s a collection of experimental scripts, tools, and coding solutions, not directly tied to my primary work but still valuable for learning and exploration.

### Current Contents:

- **BMI Calculator**: A Python script that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on input mass (kg) and height (m). It provides the BMI value along with a classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese) and generates an informative plot.
  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Code snippets for evaluating models using various metrics, useful for machine learning and statistical analysis.

- **ML Datasets**:
  - **MNIST**: A set of scripts to work with the MNIST dataset, a benchmark in image classification.
  - **Red Wine Quality**: Code for analyzing the famous Red Wine Quality dataset, focused on predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques.
  - **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**: A classic Kaggle competition project focused on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. Involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and binary classification using multiple machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), LightGBM, and XGBoost to predict survival outcomes based on passenger demographics and ticket information.

This repository serves as a growing collection of useful scripts and projects that I explore in my spare time. Feel free to browse, use, or contribute to anything that interests you.
