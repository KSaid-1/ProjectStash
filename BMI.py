# Calculate Body mass index (BMI) which is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/mÂ², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres
mass = float(input("Mass in kilograms? "))
height = float(input("Height in metres? "))
bmi = mass/height**2
print ("Body mass index = ",bmi)
if bmi < 18.5:
    print ("Underweight")
if 18.5 <= bmi <= 24.9:
    print ("Normal weight")
if 24.9 < bmi <= 29.9:
    print ("Overweight")
if bmi > 29.9:
